## Log
1. 20201013 Dropped nodemon in favor of `spago --then`; Used `osa notify` to send notifications that ps was building
2. 20201014 Created `src/OSX` library for mac related terminal commands
3. 20201015 Created `src/Google` library for google authentication

## TODOS:
1. Validate command line args.  For example indices should be between 1-2999.  Also, is there a way to determine if a string is a Japanese kanji by looking at it's CharPoint
